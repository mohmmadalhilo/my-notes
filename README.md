## Introduction About Me

My name is ***Mohmad Al.hilo***, and I'm a recent computer science graduate from *Alzaytoonah University*.

I have previously taken courses in developing a mobile application using *framework flutter* some of this courses :

**And I want to laren Ui Ux for 3 Reasons:**

1. Implement new technologies

The purpose of creating an e-commerce website or an app is to keep customers hooked and generate sales. For this, a great user experience is crucial. The reason why people spend hours on Instagram or prefer Booking.com to book their stays is all due to a great user experience design.

2. UX Design a Good Career Choice.

One of the weighing factors of a stable career is whether or not you can rely on the job to still be around in 5, 10, or 20 years. Fortunately, the future looks good for UX/UI designers. Not only is the position currently in very high demand, but the industry is projected to grow at a steady rate in the coming years.

3. Can Create More Enjoyable App Experiences

UX isn’t just for serious stuff – it also helps us to derive pleasure from the time we spend using technology. Snapchat (and those Spectacles) shows that in app design there is room for the silly and superfluous, so long as the product enhances people’s connections to one another, and helps us to find the delight in everyday technology.

## Learn the fundamentals of a good developer

 Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.

one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.
Bad developers don’t understand what they are doing, and good developers do.

Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.

 How could you avoid being a victim?
First, you will exactly know your software purpose and its definition. Second, you will be as simple as possible in every piece of code you write. Third, when a new feature or change request comes to the discussion table, you will evaluate them based on your software purpose and question them.

As a developer, your first behavior should be resistance to (unnecessary) change
Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

**Rule that you should follow about maintenance is:**

1. It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

2. Solving Problems Give your brain some time to analyze the problem and process the information but don’t spend too much time on planning.
To avoid being a victim like this developer

Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

*Code Simplicity*
Resistance Go back and remember your software purpose.

Then remember the simple equation in prioritizing section.
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.

Documentation Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”.

Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
